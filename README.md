# EU Cookie Directive Bar

This very simple and lightweight javascript module aims to add a small top bar on your website to display a custom message to your visitors, in compliance with the [European Union Directive about cookies and privacy](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm).

This module provides only a warning to visitors. Ideally it should contain a link to your Terms or Privacy page with instructions on what are cookies, and how to prevent cookies to be installed on your website. 

The directive allows for this kind of "only warning and instructions" versions (in any case this module blocks incoming cookies), which are widely used by various high-traffic, well-recognized websites.

**Demo is available at [github.io](http://sebastien-bartoli.github.io/eu-cookie/)**

## Usage

Upload the folder anywhere on the internet, but preferably on one of your webserver. Replace the options in `index.html` (see below) with your context. 

Only options 4 through 7 will need to be changed : 

- **4** : replace `//cdn.example.org` with the domain where the folder is uploaded. The `//` before the URL insure the content will be loaded asynchronously AND using http or https depending on what's available.
- **5** : except if you have changed the structure of the folder, you shouldn't have to change this.
- **6** : change `subdomain.example.org` with the domain or subdomain on which you want the cookie to be applied (it should probably be the domain on which you are loading the bar).
- **7** : you can add another, optional 7th option, that many will probably use, in order to completely customize the displayed text. It can handle any HTML code, so have fun.

```HTML
<!-- EU Cookie Directive Bar loads here  -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(eu,c,o,ok,i,e,law,loa,de,r){
    de=c.createElement(o);r=c.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];de.async=1;de.src=ok+i;
    r.parentNode.insertBefore(de,r);eu.cmDomain=e;eu.cmCDN=ok;eu.cmTextContent=law
  })(window,document,'script','//cdn.example.org/','/js/cookie-manager.js','subdomain.example.org');
</script>
<!-- End of EU Cookie Directive Bar -->
```

Then, copy-paste the modified content of `index.html` anywhere on your website, and voila! You're done.
