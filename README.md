This very simple, lightweight & responsive javascript UI component aims to add a small top bar on your website to display a custom message to your visitors, in compliance with the [European Union Directive about cookies and privacy](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm).

This component provides only a warning to visitors. Ideally it should contain a link to your Terms or Privacy page with instructions on what are cookies, and how to prevent cookies to be installed on the user's browser. 

The EU directive allows for this kind of "only warning and instructions" versions **(this component DOES NOT blocks incoming cookies)**, which are widely used by various high-traffic, well-recognized websites, such as [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/fr/), [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr) or [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com).

## Usage

Upload the folder anywhere on the internet, but preferably on one of your webserver. Replace the options in the code below with your context.

Parameters 4 through 8 might need to be changed to accomodate your configuration : 

- **4** : `(string)` replace `//cdn.example.org` with the domain where the folder is uploaded. The `//` before the URL insure the content will be loaded asynchronously AND using http or https depending on what's available.
- **5** : `(string)` except if you have changed the structure of the folders, you shouldn't have to change this.
- **6** : `(string)` change `subdomain.example.org` with the domain or subdomain on which you want the cookie to be applied (it should probably be the domain on which you are loading the bar).
- **7** : `(string) OR (object/json)`you can add another, optional 7th option, that many will probably use, in order to completely customize the displayed text. It can handle any HTML code. It can also be a JSON object which will change only the specified parts of the default text content :
    -  `text` : the content of the text before the link
    - `href` : the URL of the link
    - `linktext` : the link text content
- **8** : `(object/json)` an 8th argument is a JSON object for the colors of the cookie-bar. It recognizes 5 different properties, and each property accept any valid rgb, rgba, hexadecimal ( 3 or 6 ) or webcolor name value :
    - `link` : the color of the links in the cookie-bar and also of the "x" symbol to close it
    - `hover` : the color of the links and "x" symbol when the cursor is over it
    - `color` : the color of the text
    - `border` : the bottom border color
    - `background` : the background color of the bar
=======
**Demo is available at [github.io](http://sebastien-bartoli.github.io/eu-cookie/)**

You can see on the demo, that the bar appears at each reload. That is because the cookie is getting deleted each time so you can see how it works, on production website, once accepted ( clicked on the link or on the X symbol ), it won't appear for a year or until the user deletes cookies.

## Usage

Upload the folder anywhere on the internet, but preferably on one of your webserver. Replace the options in `index.html` (see below) with your context. 

Parameters 4 through 7 will need to be changed to accomodate your configuration : 

- **4** : replace `//cdn.example.org` with the domain where the folder is uploaded. The `//` before the URL insure the content will be loaded asynchronously AND using http or https depending on what's available.
- **5** : except if you have changed the structure of the folders, you shouldn't have to change this.
- **6** : change `subdomain.example.org` with the domain or subdomain on which you want the cookie to be applied (it should probably be the domain on which you are loading the bar).
- **7** : you can add another, optional 7th option, that many will probably use, in order to completely customize the displayed text. It can handle any HTML code, so have fun.
