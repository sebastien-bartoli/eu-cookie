{"name":"Eu-cookie","tagline":"A simple & lightweight UI component for compliance with the EU Directive about cookies and privacy.","body":"# EU Cookie Directive Bar\r\n\r\nThis very simple and lightweight javascript module aims to add a small top bar on your website to display a custom message to your visitors, in compliance with the [European Union Directive about cookies and privacy](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm).\r\n\r\nThis module provides only a warning to visitors. Ideally it should contain a link to your Terms or Privacy page with instructions on what are cookies, and how to prevent cookies to be installed on your website. \r\n\r\nThe directive allows for this kind of \"only warning and instructions\" versions (in any case this module blocks incoming cookies), which are widely used by various high-traffic, well-recognized websites.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUpload the folder anywhere on the internet, but preferably on one of your webserver. Replace the options in `index.html` (see below) with your context. \r\n\r\nOnly options 4 through 7 will need to be changed : \r\n\r\n- **4** : replace `//cdn.example.org` with the domain where the folder is uploaded. The `//` before the URL insure the content will be loaded asynchronously AND using http or https depending on what's available.\r\n- **5** : except if you have changed the structure of the folder, you shouldn't have to change this.\r\n- **6** : change `subdomain.example.org` with the domain or subdomain on which you want the cookie to be applied (it should probably be the domain on which you are loading the bar).\r\n- **7** : you can add another, optional 7th option, that many will probably use, in order to completely customize the displayed text. It can handle any HTML code, so have fun.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- EU Cookie Directive Bar loads here  -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  (function(eu,c,o,ok,i,e,law,lo,de,r){\r\n    de=c.createElement(o);r=c.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];de.async=1;de.src=ok+i;\r\n    r.parentNode.insertBefore(de,r);eu.cmDomain=e;eu.cmCDN=ok;eu.cmTextContent=law\r\n  })(window, document,'script','//cdn.example.org/','/js/cookie-manager.js','subdomain.example.org');\r\n</script>\r\n<!-- End of EU Cookie Directive Bar -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, copy-paste the modified content of `index.html` anywhere on your website, and voila! You're done.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n- [jQuery 1.11.1](http://jquery.com)\r\n- [jquery.cookie.js](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie)\r\n- [Foundation Icons Fonts 3](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3)\r\n\r\nAll are included into the repo and loaded automagically by the module without need for intervention. jQuery is loaded only if the hosting website isn't available.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 SÃ©bastien Bartoli\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
